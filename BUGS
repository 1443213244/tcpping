If the sending interval is near or less than the RTT of the connection then you
will get artifically deflated ping times.

For example, if your destination is 300ms away and your sending interval is
100ms, you'll get <100ms times reported as it simply accepts the "last received
packet" instead of the packet that was really sent.
