Picked up some instances of duplicated sequence numbers when we were getting duplicated responses.

jim@eiko tcpping $ sudo ./tcpping x -I wlan0 -i 1.0
TCP PING x (x:80)
SYN/ACK from x: seq=1 ttl=51 time=465.634ms
SYN/ACK from x: seq=2 ttl=51 time=489.545ms
SYN/ACK from x: seq=2 ttl=51 time=490.450ms
SYN/ACK from x: seq=3 ttl=51 time=308.855ms

We are getting duplicated SYN/ACK packets; it looks like the fix we put in
place to detect that isn't working quite right.
