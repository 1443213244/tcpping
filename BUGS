It currently doesn't run properly on Mac OS X:

TCP PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1:80)
libnet_write: libnet_write_raw_ipv4(): -1 bytes written (Invalid argument)

It looks like this has to do with one of the peculiarities of libnet1.  I'm
sure it's a fine library but I was not able to get something working on a Mac
that, by all accounts, should work fine.

Therefore, I'm working on stripping out libnet1 support as I don't really need
it for anything and can hack in the cross-platform pieces that I need.  This
involves:

Need to be able to construct a TCP raw packet to send out
Need to be able to find a source IP address based on a destination
Need to be able to find an if device name based on source IP

All of these are easily solvable, just need some legwork.  Then I can do my own
cross-platform compatibility.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have to specify an IP address to ping.  I should sort that out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm able to get this thing to respond to duplicate packets.  I'll resume
ripping out libnet and see if that sticks around, but I don't like it.

Things I tried:

- Seeing if there were rogue sending processes that weren't killed by the
  interrupt (there didn't seem to be, either by ps or tcpdump)
- Adding and removing options (didn't seem to matter)

What to try next:

- tcpdump while doing a tcpping.  That should sort all of this out.
