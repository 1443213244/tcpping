There are a few known bugs:

- There seem to be occasionally some issues with tcpping being longer-running,
  but that might just be because I ran it in gdb and I'm not sure what signals
  were trapped where for termination.  Will watch further.  In the meantime,
  you might want to check for background tcppings.

- Make sure that when a packet is "Timed out" that it will not count as an
  eligible received packet later.  This is easiest done by the same method that
  stops duplications.
