There are a few known bugs:

- For some reason, when using the -S tag, outputting the SYN/ACK or RST
  responses puts some invalid characters in the output stream, and leaving it
  off just outputs periods (.).  It looks like the output stream is getting
  some junk or corrupted somewhere, or the parent process is outputting
  something.  I'll try to track it down.  

- findDevice() never seems to work.  You can get around this by supplying the
  interface option (-I).  But this does need to get solved.

- There seem to be occasionally some issues with tcpping being longer-running,
  but that might just be because I ran it in gdb and I'm not sure what signals
  were trapped where for termination.  Will watch further.  In the meantime,
  you might want to check for background tcppings.
